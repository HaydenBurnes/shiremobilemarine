Having rich experience in the industry, Shire Mobile Marine offer fast and reliable services for mobile boat repairs and maintenance to a wide range of customers. We can repair several makes and models of inboard engines, outboard engines as well as sterndrive engines for various types of boats. We are considered as an expert for MerCruiser Sterndrives as we conduct MerCruiser Repairs in Sydney by using the advanced diagnostic tools and genuine spare parts. We also assist in pre-purchase boat inspection as we aim to provide comprehensive solutions to our customers. As a professional mobile outboard mechanic in Sutherland Shire, we check the condition of the engine thoroughly and make repairs and replacements only after discussing with the boat owner.
